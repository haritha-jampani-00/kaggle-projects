# 💤 Sleep Data Analysis

This project explores the relationship between sleep quality and various health and lifestyle factors using Python and statistical techniques.

## 📁 Dataset

- **File:** `Health_Sleep_Statistics.csv`
- Features include:
  - Demographics: Age, Gender, Occupation
  - Health metrics: Sleep Duration, Sleep Quality, Heart Rate, Stress Level, Physical Activity Level, Screen Time, Daily Steps, BMI Category

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- pandas, numpy – Data analysis
- matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization
- sklearn – Linear regression
- scipy – Statistical testing

## 📊 Key Steps

1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Drop irrelevant columns (e.g., `User ID`)
3. Analyze correlation between age and sleep quality using linear regression
4. Visualize patterns by gender and physical activity level
5. (Planned) Statistical testing for gender-based differences

## 📌 Insights

- Strong negative correlation between age and sleep quality
- Gender and physical activity level influence sleep quality
- Regression used to visualize age-based prediction

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repo or open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Upload `Health_Sleep_Statistics.csv`
3. Run all cells in the notebook

## 🚀 Future Work

- Improve statistical tests
- Explore multivariate models
- Add interactive dashboard (Streamlit)
